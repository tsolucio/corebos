 * Use this as a marker for displaying another marker pointing to the original
 * point on the graph - where the 'pointer' is calculated as line orthogonal to
 * a line drawn between the points neighbours to both sides (an approximate
 * tangent). This should make an the pointer appear to point 'straight' out from
 * the graph. The 'head' of the pointer is then another marker of any choice.
