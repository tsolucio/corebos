# Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the project manager either directly on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/joebordes) or as an email to [project manager](mailto:joe@corebos.org).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of the source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
