 * @todo Make sure that if there is an DTEND property, its date is after
 * this property's date.
 * 
 * RFC 2445 Definition
 * 
 * Property Name: DTSTART
 * 
 * Purpose: This property specifies when the calendar component begins.
 * 
 * Value Type: The default value type is DATE-TIME. The time value MUST
 * be one of the forms defined for the DATE-TIME value type. The value
 * type can be set to a DATE value type.
 * 
 * Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type, time zone
 * identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.
 * 
 * Conformance: This property can be specified in the "VEVENT", "VTODO",
 * "VFREEBUSY", or "VTIMEZONE" calendar components.
 * 
 * Description: Within the "VEVENT" calendar component, this property
 * defines the start date and time for the event. The property is
 * REQUIRED in "VEVENT" calendar components. Events can have a start
 * date/time but no end date/time. In that case, the event does not take
 * up any time.
 * 
 * Within the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component, this property defines the
 * start date and time for the free or busy time information. The time
 * MUST be specified in UTC time.
 * 
 * Within the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component, this property defines the
 * effective start date and time for a time zone specification. This
 * property is REQUIRED within each STANDARD and DAYLIGHT part included
 * in "VTIMEZONE" calendar components and MUST be specified as a local
 * DATE-TIME without the "TZID" property parameter.
 * 
 * Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:
 * 
 *   dtstart    = "DTSTART" dtstparam ":" dtstval CRLF
 * 
 *   dtstparam  = *(
 * 
 *              ; the following are optional,
 *              ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
 * 
 *              (";" "VALUE" "=" ("DATE-TIME" / "DATE")) /
 *              (";" tzidparam) /
 * 
 *              ; the following is optional,
 *              ; and MAY occur more than once
 * 
 *                *(";" xparam)
 * 
 *              )
 * 
 *   dtstval    = date-time / date
 *   ;Value MUST match value type
 * 
 * Example: The following is an example of this property:
 * 
 *   DTSTART:19980118T073000Z
