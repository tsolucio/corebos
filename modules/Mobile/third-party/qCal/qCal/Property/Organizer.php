 * RFC 2445 Definition
 * 
 * Property Name: ORGANIZER
 * 
 * Purpose: The property defines the organizer for a calendar component.
 * 
 * Value Type: CAL-ADDRESS
 * 
 * Property Parameters: Non-standard, language, common name, directory
 * entry reference, sent by property parameters can be specified on this
 * property.
 * 
 * Conformance: This property MUST be specified in an iCalendar object
 * that specifies a group scheduled calendar entity. This property MUST
 * be specified in an iCalendar object that specifies the publication of
 * a calendar user's busy time. This property MUST NOT be specified in
 * an iCalendar object that specifies only a time zone definition or
 * that defines calendar entities that are not group scheduled entities,
 * but are entities only on a single user's calendar.
 * 
 * Description: The property is specified within the "VEVENT", "VTODO",
 * "VJOURNAL calendar components to specify the organizer of a group
 * scheduled calendar entity. The property is specified within the
 * "VFREEBUSY" calendar component to specify the calendar user
 * requesting the free or busy time. When publishing a "VFREEBUSY"
 * calendar component, the property is used to specify the calendar that
 * the published busy time came from.
 * 
 * The property has the property parameters CN, for specifying the
 * common or display name associated with the "Organizer", DIR, for
 * specifying a pointer to the directory information associated with the
 * "Organizer", SENT-BY, for specifying another calendar user that is
 * acting on behalf of the "Organizer". The non-standard parameters may
 * also be specified on this property. If the LANGUAGE property
 * parameter is specified, the identified language applies to the CN
 * parameter value.
 * 
 * Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:
 * 
 *   organizer  = "ORGANIZER" orgparam ":"
 *                cal-address CRLF
 * 
 *   orgparam   = *(
 * 
 *              ; the following are optional,
 *           ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
 * 
 *              (";" cnparam) / (";" dirparam) / (";" sentbyparam) /
 *              (";" languageparam) /
 * 
 *              ; the following is optional,
 *              ; and MAY occur more than once
 * 
 *              (";" xparam)
 * 
 *              )
 * 
 * Example: The following is an example of this property:
 * 
 *   ORGANIZER;CN=John Smith:MAILTO:jsmith@host1.com
 * 
 * The following is an example of this property with a pointer to the
 * directory information associated with the organizer:
 * 
 *   ORGANIZER;CN=JohnSmith;DIR="ldap://host.com:6666/o=3DDC%20Associ
 *    ates,c=3DUS??(cn=3DJohn%20Smith)":MAILTO:jsmith@host1.com
 * 
 * The following is an example of this property used by another calendar
 * user who is acting on behalf of the organizer, with responses
 * intended to be sent back to the organizer, not the other calendar
 * user:
 * 
 *   ORGANIZER;SENT-BY="MAILTO:jane_doe@host.com":
 *    MAILTO:jsmith@host1.com
