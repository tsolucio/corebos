 * Time Zone Identifier Property
 * @package qCal
 * @copyright Luke Visinoni (luke.visinoni@gmail.com)
 * @author Luke Visinoni (luke.visinoni@gmail.com)
 * @license GNU Lesser General Public License
 * @todo Make sure that this must be specified in vtimezone
 * 
 * RFC 2445 Definition
 * 
 * Property Name: TZID
 * 
 * Purpose: This property specifies the text value that uniquely
 * identifies the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component.
 * 
 * Value Type: TEXT
 * 
 * Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
 * specified on this property.
 * 
 * Conformance: This property MUST be specified in a "VTIMEZONE"
 * calendar component.
 * 
 * Description: This is the label by which a time zone calendar
 * component is referenced by any iCalendar properties whose data type
 * is either DATE-TIME or TIME and not intended to specify a UTC or a
 * "floating" time. The presence of the SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII
 * decimal 47) as a prefix, indicates that this TZID represents an
 * unique ID in a globally defined time zone registry (when such
 * registry is defined).
 * 
 *      Note: This document does not define a naming convention for time
 *      zone identifiers. Implementers may want to use the naming
 *      conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such as
 *      the public-domain Olson database [TZ]. The specification of
 *      globally unique time zone identifiers is not addressed by this
 *      document and is left for future study.
 * 
 * Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
 * notation:
 * 
 *   tzid       = "TZID" tzidpropparam ":" [tzidprefix] text CRLF
 * 
 *   tzidpropparam      = *(";" xparam)
 * 
 *   ;tzidprefix        = "/"
 *   ; Defined previously. Just listed here for reader convenience.
 * 
 * Example: The following are examples of non-globally unique time zone
 * identifiers:
 * 
 *   TZID:US-Eastern
 * 
 *   TZID:California-Los_Angeles
 * 
 * The following is an example of a fictitious globally unique time zone
 * identifier:
 * 
 *   TZID:/US-New_York-New_York
