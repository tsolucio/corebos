 * RFC 2445 Definition

 * Property Name: RDATE
 * 
 * Purpose: This property defines the list of date/times for a
 * recurrence set.
 * 
 * Value Type: The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
 * The value type can be set to DATE or PERIOD.
 * 
 * Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type and time zone
 * identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.
 * 
 * Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO",
 * "VJOURNAL" or "VTIMEZONE" calendar components.
 * 
 * Description: This property can appear along with the "RRULE" property
 * to define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences. When they both
 * appear in an iCalendar object, the recurring events are defined by
 * the union of occurrences defined by both the "RDATE" and "RRULE".
 * 
 * The recurrence dates, if specified, are used in computing the
 * recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of recurrence
 * instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is generated
 * by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with the "RRULE",
 * "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained within the
 * iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first instance
 * in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and "EXRULE"
 * properties can also be specified to define more sophisticated
 * recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
 * all of the start date/times generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
 * and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start date/times which fall
 * within the union of start date/times generated by any specified
 * "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that start date/times
 * within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE" and "EXRULE")
 * take precedence over those specified by inclusion properties (i.e.,
 * "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are generated by the
 * "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence is considered.
 * Duplicate instances are ignored.
 * 
 * Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:
 * 
 *   rdate      = "RDATE" rdtparam ":" rdtval *("," rdtval) CRLF
 * 
 *   rdtparam   = *(
 * 
 *              ; the following are optional,
 *              ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
 * 
 *              (";" "VALUE" "=" ("DATE-TIME" / "DATE" / "PERIOD")) /
 *              (";" tzidparam) /
 * 
 *              ; the following is optional,
 *              ; and MAY occur more than once
 * 
 *              (";" xparam)
 * 
 *              )
 * 
 *   rdtval     = date-time / date / period
 *   ;Value MUST match value type
 * 
 * Example: The following are examples of this property:
 * 
 *   RDATE:19970714T123000Z
 * 
 *   RDATE;TZID=US-EASTERN:19970714T083000
 * 
 *   RDATE;VALUE=PERIOD:19960403T020000Z/19960403T040000Z,
 *    19960404T010000Z/PT3H
 * 
 *   RDATE;VALUE=DATE:19970101,19970120,19970217,19970421
 *    19970526,19970704,19970901,19971014,19971128,19971129,19971225
