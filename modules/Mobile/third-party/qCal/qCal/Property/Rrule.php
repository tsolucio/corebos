 * @todo Make sure allowedCompoents is correct. The RFC isn't dead clear
 * @todo There are a lot of rules for this guy. Make sure you take them all

 * 
 * RFC 2445 Definition
 * 
 * Property Name: RRULE
 * 
 * Purpose: This property defines a rule or repeating pattern for
 * recurring events, to-dos, or time zone definitions.
 * 
 * Value Type: RECUR
 * 
 * Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
 * specified on this property.
 * 
 * Conformance: This property can be specified one or more times in
 * recurring "VEVENT", "VTODO" and "VJOURNAL" calendar components. It
 * can also be specified once in each STANDARD or DAYLIGHT sub-component
 * of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component.
 * 
 * Description: The recurrence rule, if specified, is used in computing
 * the recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of
 * recurrence instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is
 * generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with
 * the "RRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained
 * within the iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first
 * instance in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and
 * "EXRULE" properties can also be specified to define more
 * sophisticated recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated
 * by gathering all of the start date/times generated by any of the
 * specified "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start
 * date/times which fall within the union of start date/times generated
 * by any specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that
 * start date/times within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE"
 * and "EXRULE") take precedence over those specified by inclusion
 * properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
 * generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
 * is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The "DTSTART" and "DTEND" property pair or "DTSTART" and "DURATION"
 * property pair, specified within the iCalendar object defines the
 * first instance of the recurrence. When used with a recurrence rule,
 * the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties MUST be specified in local time
 * and the appropriate set of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components MUST be
 * included. For detail on the usage of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar
 * component, see the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component definition.
 * 
 * Any duration associated with the iCalendar object applies to all
 * members of the generated recurrence set. Any modified duration for
 * specific recurrences MUST be explicitly specified using the "RDATE"
 * property.
 * 
 * Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
 * notation:
 * 
 *   rrule      = "RRULE" rrulparam ":" recur CRLF
 * 
 *   rrulparam  = *(";" xparam)
 * 
 * Example: All examples assume the Eastern United States time zone.
