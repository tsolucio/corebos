 * The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object is a collection of
 * calendaring and scheduling information. Typically, this information
 * will consist of a single iCalendar object. However, multiple
 * iCalendar objects can be sequentially grouped together. The first
 * line and last line of the iCalendar object MUST contain a pair of
 * iCalendar object delimiter strings. The syntax for an iCalendar
 * object is as follows:
 * 
 *   icalobject = 1*("BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
 *                icalbody
 *                "END" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF)
 * 
 * The following is a simple example of an iCalendar object:
 * 
 *   BEGIN:VCALENDAR
 *   VERSION:2.0
 *   PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
 *   BEGIN:VEVENT
 *   DTSTART:19970714T170000Z
 *   DTEND:19970715T035959Z
 *   SUMMARY:Bastille Day Party
 *   END:VEVENT
 *   END:VCALENDAR
