**core Business Operating System** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tsolucio/corebos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tsolucio/corebos)

**coreBOS** is a very flexible and powerful software application designed to easily adapt to the requirements of your business. In other words, a business software capable of managing the everyday needs of your business.

To accomplish such a gigantic task it has many mechanisms to make your work productive while giving implementors and administrators the power to configure and adapt the software to the immense variety of business situations it may be applied to.

With a business-friendly license and fully open source philosophy where your data and your customizations are always yours, coreBOS can cover the needs of a very wide range of market segments and also serve as a base for implementors to service their clients.

coreBOS is backed by a small but consistent community and patronized by [TSolucio](https://tsolucio.com) who not only bases its business on this software but gives it the power and stability to move into the future with confidence.

We invite you to[ give it a try](http://corebos.org/documentation/doku.php?id=en:install550) and dedicate a few hours of [reading the blog](http://blog.corebos.org), [the forum](http://discussions.corebos.org/) and [our gitter channel](https://gitter.im/corebos/discuss) to understand the **power** this application has and the many things it can do.
